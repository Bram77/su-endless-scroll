# suEndlessScroll
Endless scrolling for AngularJS

This module has been inspired by sroze his ngInfiniteScroll module (http://sroze.github.com/ngInfiniteScroll/). It wasn't working in my project and I found his code a bit over complicated for the task. Less code == less issues. 
That's why I've created my own version. No code from his project has been used, whatsoever.
